2. **Try different lighting** - good lighting improves accuracy
3. **Use high-resolution** images when possible
4. **Avoid shadows** and reflections on text

### **If File Upload Fails:**
1. **Check file format** - ensure it's TXT, PDF, or DOC
2. **Verify file size** - very large files may take longer
3. **Check permissions** - ensure storage access is granted
4. **Try different files** to isolate the issue

### **If App Crashes:**
1. **Restart the app** and try again
2. **Check device storage** - ensure sufficient space
3. **Update Flutter** if using development version
4. **Report the issue** with device details

## 📊 **Performance Expectations**

### **Processing Times:**
- **TXT files**: Instant (< 1 second)
- **PDF files**: 1-3 seconds (depending on pages)
- **Small images**: 2-4 seconds
- **Large images**: 5-10 seconds
- **Complex documents**: 10-15 seconds

### **Memory Usage:**
- **Text processing**: Minimal impact
- **Image processing**: Moderate memory usage during OCR
- **File handling**: Efficient with automatic cleanup

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

### **You'll Know It's Working When:**
- ✅ **Text appears** in the input field after processing
- ✅ **Success message** shows "Text extracted successfully!"
- ✅ **TTS works** with the extracted text
